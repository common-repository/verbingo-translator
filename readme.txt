Verbingo Translator is a product of Verbatim Solutions which is one of the leading translation companies in the world.
   
== Description ==
This plugin is based on Verbingo API which services over 100 languages! The plugin allows for instant html page translation and also allows the user to load a file and get a translated file back (via email). Both types of translation are machine-based (MT). First-time translations may display slowly depending on the size and complexity of the page. After the first time, the data for that page gets loaded in the database which allows translations on subsequent visits to appear very quickly.
Html translation can be edited by the user from the admin interface. File translations allow translation of popular file formats like MS Word, PDF, IDML, txt, html etc. 
For any and all questions or assistance regarding this plugin or additional translation services, Verbatim Solutions is standing by to help. For further information please contact us on tim@verbatimsolutions.com.
